# Plugin that uses `bindSym` against an overloaded name. `add` has multiple
# overloads in `system` (string+char, string+string, seq+T) — bindSym at
# plugin sem time emits a `(cchoice add.0.X add.1.X …)` subtree which is
# parsed at runtime and appended into the output via `bindSymHelper`. Sem at
# the call site then resolves the choice against the actual argument types.
