# `const c: seq[T] = @[...]` is compile-time evaluable via the sub-compile
# in `exprexec`. The runtime `@` runs in the sub-compile, then the
# resulting `seq[T]` is serialised back into NIF using the ptr-to-nif rule
# for the `data: ptr UncheckedArray[T]` field — emitted as
# `(addr (aconstr (uarray T) e1 ... eN))`. Hexer's nifcgen hoists the
# aconstr to an anonymous module-level static array and rewrites the
# `addr` to a `cast` pointing at it.

# instantiated stub itself doesn't cross the boundary).
