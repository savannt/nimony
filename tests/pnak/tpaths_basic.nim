## Integration test for `pnak fetch` end-to-end.
##
## Stays offline by spinning up a tiny local git repository as the
## "upstream" and pointing at it via a `file://` URL — so the test does
## not depend on network reachability or the cached packages.json. The
## assertions cover the two behaviours that broke historically:
##
##   1. The dependency BFS produces a `nimony.paths` file next to the
##      input `.nimble`, with the resolved package's `src/` directory
##      listed inside the pnak-managed block.
##   2. Re-running pnak is idempotent and preserves any user content
##      outside the managed block (the original `nim.cfg` patcher had a
##      regression where the marker line was clobbered).
##
## Run manually:
##   hastur build pnak                          # builds bin/pnak
##   nim c -r tests/pnak/tpaths_basic.nim       # builds and runs this test
