  Feature* = enum ## A feature is a language mode that is purely frontend-related.
                  ## A `CheckMode` is something Hexer needs to know about too.
    InvalidFeature
    ResemChoiceFeature
    UntypedFeature
    CanRaiseFeature
    LenientConvertersFeature
    EarlyMagicsFeature
    AutoClosuresFeature
    LenientNilsFeature
    IgnoreStyleFeature
      ## Nim-2-style "style insensitivity": identifier lookup ignores
      ## underscores and ASCII case after the first character. Strictly a
      ## sem-frontend toggle; hexer / lengc / nifmake are unaffected.
    VarToverloadsFeature
      ## Nim-2-style overloading by `var T`: when two routines differ only
      ## in whether a parameter is `var T` or `T`, prefer the `var T`
      ## overload (mirrors `sumGeneric` +1 for `tyVar` in old Nim's
      ## `complexDisambiguation`).
    LenientFloatsFeature
      ## Nim-2-style implicit narrowing of float *values* (named constants and
      ## arbitrary expressions, not just literals) to a smaller float type,
      ## e.g. passing a `float64` constant where a `float32` is expected. Off by
      ## default because the narrowing can silently lose precision; opt in with
      ## `.feature: "lenientFloats".` (v2 implies it).
